  <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
  <img src="https://photos-6.dropbox.com/t/2/AAD1Ij7cj9tzAMQfAwEoGM2GOrAKMwooQkV9ePAYPvkXlg/12/221541231/png/32x32/1/_/1/2/Hicks_Law.png/CO_m0WkgASACIAMgBCAFIAYgBygBKAI/BfQGQHTmY3agRockjvkhCTOec4tL0i3aV8IhK2xksQM?size=1024x768&size_mode=2">
  <h3><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a></h3>
  <p>This is an excellent example of Hick's Law. It does many things, but it doesn't let you know that from the start. You go because you have a question about science or math, and you don't have to follow any series of links to get your answer or scroll down a list of topics. One simply has to type in a question, and the advanced software interprets the question and finds the answer with a surpristing degree of accuracy and completeness. When I go to search for answers on other scientific classroom sites, I generally have to scroll around or search for a while just to find the correct theme and then once I have found the theme, I still have to go up and down the page until I find the answer I was actually looking for, and by then, if it wasn't essential, I lost interest. Wolfram indeed takes care of most of the work and leaves very little for you to do.</p>

  <h2>Chunking</h2>
  <img src="https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/2/AADM6zcf8zMmToN9UFUztMSpLGaQ4moojMsiuuypEU2Bpw/12/221541231/png/32x32/1/_/1/2/Chunking.png/CO_m0WkgASACIAMgBCAFIAYgBygBKAI/LAmFUSB-BCp9hzw-T2cWBxaR0r9JyUCznuyfA_U2yWo?size=1024x768&size_mode=2">
  <h3><a href="www.twitter.com">Twitter</a></h3>
  <p>Twitter is the ideal example of chunking because of its 'tweets', where users must state all that they have to say in 140 characters or less. It provides an easy way to scroll through different announcements and news updates, without overloading our senses with unnecessary information. The downside to this website is the inability to provide full details when desired. People work around this with links.</p>

  <h3><a href="http://mormon.org/">Mormon.org</a></h3>
  <p>This website is so simple and intuitive. It was built to answer questions about probably the most misunderstood church of all time. As such, it was imperative that the website be easy to navigate and use. The whole website is very intuitive by having, at the top, different methods of viewing questions and their answers. For those who have a specific question in mind, you simply click the 'FAQ' section and the questions (and several different answers) are organized by category. If you are more used to a social media type situation and just want to learn more; back at the top you click the 'People' section where you find individual profiles and the questions they answer and the things they say. I especially like this search area because it is a simple matter of inputting a search term in any of the categories and then shuffling through the pictures as if you were doing so in real life.</p>

  <h2>Modularity</h2>

  <h3><a href="https://google.com/">Google</a></h3>
  <p>Google has to be the most developed and complete web service in existence. First known for its search engine, it now has a standardized collaborative online office suite, the largest video publishing site, a pleasantly simple social media outlet, an incomparable maps service and gps navigation program, a beautiful and comprehensive email client, and an extremely effective store for mobile videos, music, books, and applications. These are only a small part of their all-encompassing endeavors, each of these separately developed and maintained, but masterfully intertwined to create the ultimate user experience.</p>

  <h2>Signal-To-Noise</h2>

  <h3><a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a></h3>
  <p>Spotify has a very simple web player (very much like the desktop app) You have 5 simple options on the left, 7 simple controls on the right, and your music in the middle. It gives you all you need and only what you need to access the music you love. It's a simple and beautiful dark grey with white accents. Even the advertisements with which it is supported are clean and simple. The audio is brief and infrequent, and the access to the advertiser, if desired, is quick and easy, even though it's technically a radio ad, there's a banner that can be clicked. All in all, it's a very comfortable experience. </p>
