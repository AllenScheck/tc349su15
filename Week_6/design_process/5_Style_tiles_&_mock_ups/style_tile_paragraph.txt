The idea behind the function of the webpage is to follow the rule of thirds. The kind of information being displayed is not the kind that needs to take up the entire screen. In following the rule of thirds, it becomes easier to compartmentalize the most important information.
The style tile that was chosen in the end was chosen due to the positioning of the menu bar. There's already a lot weighing down the top of webpages and browsers and it is rather counterproductive to add one more thing to the top, so the bar on the side was more ideal and prone to more frequent use.
FYI: The main focus of the website is the search page, so I focused on that, but in order to make sure I still got what you wanted, I did the "home page" as well.
Full comps are becoming more and more outdated. Coding in HTML is becoming more and more complete, and much easier, and as such, using photoshop to create a picture-perfect representation is out-of-date. A client should get a good idea of the website's features from the style-tiles, and changes are easy to make to the html when they want to tweak the final product. I prefer to go for the rough style tile with my design.
